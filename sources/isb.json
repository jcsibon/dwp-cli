        "isbPrerequisites": "UFDsim simulates the development of an Unconventional Factory Development of a core\narea taking into account a number of technical and economic parameters, and subject to a\nmaximum daily export capacity constraint. This permits a quick evaluation of the production\npotential and its economic value, and also of the environmental impact in terms of water,\nland use, and greenhouse gases emissions. Curves of IRR = f (integrated well cost) are\ncomputed for several values of well EUR and indicate the maximum well cost compatible with\na desired level of profitability.\nThe time scale plays an important role in UFDsim. Basic pad development tasks (rig up,\ndrilling, rig down, rig move, etc.) are defined in days. On the other hand the time unit of the\neconomic model is in years. A 30-year model with a time unit of a day would require a\ndimension of 10950 for all vectors, which considerably slows down computations, and also\nprecludes visualization of the results (e.g., Gantt charts). UFDsim uses the month as time unit,\na reasonable compromise. Durations in days are rounded to the nearest months and\neconomic variables are computed on a monthly basis and aggregated yearly for a simplified\npre-tax economic analysis.\nInput Worksheets\nControl sheet holds most input parameters.\nPlanning defines the duration of 14 pad development tasks grouped into 4 phases.\nProfiles holds 3 gas profiles and possibly 3 condensate profiles and a water prod. profile.\nEconomics allows the user to manually define yearly gas and condensate prices, CPF\nconstruction costs, and other surface installation CAPEX.\nSchedule allows the user to define the starting month for each rig.\nOutput Worksheets\nControl sheet holds most output results and graphs.\nGantt holds drilling and fracking Gantt charts, and pad connection schedule.\nEconomics holds yearly economic results.\nProduction holds the gas production profiles of the pads and of the lease area.\nProduction 2 holds the condensate production profiles of the pads & of the lease area.\nWater holds the water production profiles of the pads and of the lease area.\nSensitivities holds sensitivities of NPV and IRR to rig count.",
